The following diagram shows the main concepts of Variables ontology with their relations. The unqualified names belong to the Variables ontology. Any object can be associated with a Property or its subclass Variable to provide additional information about some of its property. The Property can be associated with multiple PropertyStates that represent its value in different Contexts. Similary, a Variable can be associated with Constraints that restrict its values in particular Contexts.
